# cointicker_app_flutter_course

A new Flutter project.

A practice App from Udemy's The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart with Angela Yu course

A simple App that shows the exchange rate of some crypto currency and multiple real life currency with coinAPI

This app works just fine except that the API would only take so much request in 24 hours that it limits and make it error (HTTP 429 error)
